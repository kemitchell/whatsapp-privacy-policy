  <h1>WhatsApp Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last modified: December 19, 2019</p>
  <p><em>If you live in the <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/26000121">European Region</a>, WhatsApp Ireland Limited provides the services to you under this <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/terms-of-service-eea">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy-eea">Privacy Policy</a>.</em></p>
  <h3>WhatsApp Legal Info</h3>
  <p>If you live outside the <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/26000121">European Region</a>, WhatsApp LLC ("WhatsApp," "our," "we," or "us") provides our Services to you under this <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  <p>Our Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") helps explain our data practices, including the information we process to provide our Services.</p>
  <p>For example, our Privacy Policy talks about what information we collect and how this affects you. It also explains the steps we take to protect your privacy, like building our Services so delivered messages aren’t stored by us and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.</p>
  <p>We are one of the <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies">Facebook Companies</a>. You can learn more further below in this Privacy Policy about the ways in which we share information across this family of companies.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services unless specified otherwise.</p>
  <p>Please also read WhatsApp’s <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> ("Terms"), which describe the terms under which you use and we provide our Services.</p>
  <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>WhatsApp must receive or collect some information to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.</p>
  <p>The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. We require certain information to deliver our Services and without this we will not be able to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services.</p>
  <p>Our Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature. For example, you cannot share your location with your contacts if you do not permit us to collect your location data from your device. Permissions can be managed through your Settings menu on both <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/security-and-privacy/about-whatsapp-permissions">Android</a> and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/security-and-privacy/about-whatsapp-permissions">iOS</a> devices.</p>
  <h4>Information You Provide</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Your Account Information</strong>. You must provide your mobile phone number and basic information (including a profile name of your choice) to create a WhatsApp account. If you don’t provide us with this information, you will not be able to create an account to use our Services. You can add other information to your account, such as a profile picture and "about" information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Your Messages</strong>. We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically stored on our servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. The following scenarios describe circumstances where we may store your messages in the course of delivering them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Undelivered Messages</strong>. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if the recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Media Forwarding</strong>. When a user forwards media within a message, we store that media temporarily in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery of additional forwards.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them. Learn more about <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption</a> and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption-for-business-messages">how businesses communicate with you on WhatsApp</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Your Connections</strong>. You can use the contact upload feature and provide us, if permitted by applicable laws, with the phone numbers in your address book on a regular basis, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information for you in a way that ensures those contacts cannot be identified by us. Learn more about our contact upload feature <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/contacts/about-contact-upload">here</a>. You can create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your account information. You give your groups a name. You can provide a group profile picture or description.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Status Information</strong>. You may provide us your status if you choose to include one on your account. Learn how to use status on <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/status/how-to-use-status">Android</a>, <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/status/how-to-use-status">iPhone</a>, or <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/kaios/status/how-to-create-and-send-a-status-update">KaiOS</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Transactions And Payments Data</strong>. If you use our payments services, or use our Services meant for purchases or other financial transactions, we process additional information about you, including payment account and transaction information. Payment account and transaction information includes information needed to complete the transaction (for example, information about your payment method, shipping details and transaction amount). If you use our payments services available in your country or territory, our privacy practices are described in the applicable payments privacy policy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Customer Support And Other Communications</strong>. When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you deem helpful, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may send us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Automatically Collected Information</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Usage And Log Information</strong>. We collect information about your activity on our Services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (including how you use our Services, your Services settings, how you interact with others using our Services (including when you interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities and interactions), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, calling, Status, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, "about" information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your "last seen"); and when you last updated your "about" information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Device And Connection Information</strong>. We collect device and connection-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network, connection information (including phone number, mobile operator or ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information, and identifiers (including identifiers unique to <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products">Facebook Company Products</a> associated with the same device or account).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Location Information</strong>. We collect and use precise location information from your device with your permission when you choose to use location-related features, like when you decide to share your location with your contacts or view locations nearby or locations others have shared with you. There are certain settings relating to location-related information which you can find in your device settings or the in-app settings, such as location sharing. Even if you do not use our location-related features, we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate your general location (e.g., city and country). We also use your location information for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong>. We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customize them. For example, we use cookies to provide our Services for web and desktop and other web-based services. We may also use cookies to understand which of our Help Center articles are most popular and to show you relevant content related to our Services. Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to provide a safer experience, and otherwise to customize our Services for you. <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/cookies">Learn more</a> about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Third-Party Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Information Others Provide About You</strong>. We receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number, name, and other information (like information from their mobile address book) just as you may provide theirs. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us.</p>
      <p><br>
      You should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to WhatsApp or anyone else, or post them on another platform.<br></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>User Reports</strong>. Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is made, we collect information on both the reporting user and reported user. To find out more about what happens when a user report is made, please see <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/staying-safe-on-whatsapp">Advanced Safety and Security Features</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Businesses On WhatsApp</strong>. Businesses you interact with using our Services may provide us with information about their interactions with you. We require each of these businesses to act in accordance with applicable law when providing any information to us.</p>
      <p><br>
      When you message with a business on WhatsApp, keep in mind that the content you share may be visible to several people in that business. In addition, some businesses might be working with third-party service providers (which may include Facebook) to help manage their communications with their customers. For example, a business may give such third-party service provider access to its communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process them for the business. To understand how a business processes your information, including how it might share your information with third parties or Facebook, you should review that business’ privacy policy or contact the business directly.<br></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Third-Party Service Providers</strong>. We work with third-party service providers and other <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies">Facebook Companies</a> to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we work with them to distribute our apps; provide our technical and physical infrastructure, delivery, and other systems; provide engineering support, cybersecurity support, and operational support; supply location, map, and places information; process payments; help us understand how people use our Services; market our Services; help you connect with businesses using our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; ensure safety, security and integrity; and help with customer service. These companies may provide us with information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores may provide us with reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues.</p>

We allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products">Facebook Company Products</a>. If you use our Services with such third-party services or <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products">Facebook Company Products</a>, we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services, or if you choose to access our Services through a mobile carrier’s or device provider’s promotion of our Services.

We enable you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate and interact with each other using our services, such as <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-catalog">Catalogs</a> for businesses on WhatsApp through which you can browse products and services and place orders. Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product and service updates; and marketing.

  <h3>Our Global Operations</h3>
